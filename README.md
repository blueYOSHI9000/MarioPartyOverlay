## How to use?
Click on the numbers to increase the counters, by holding Ctrl you can decrease them instead. The amount can be changed at the top (1, 5 or 10).  
It's possible to switch between 1 and 5/10 by holding Shift.  
To give/take the coin-star you just click on the character.

Characters and counters can both be changed at the top.

Settings can be found by clicking on the gear and then "Open Settings" (or by clicking on the gear while holding Ctrl).

A more extensive (and likely up-to-date) introduction can by found by clicking on the gear and then "Credits".
